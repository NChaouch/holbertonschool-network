### What Happens When You Type `https://www.google.com` in Your Browser and Press Enter?

Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type a URL into your browser and hit Enter? Here’s a simplified breakdown of the key steps involved:

---

### Step 1: **DNS Resolution**
Your browser needs to translate the domain name (`www.google.com`) into an IP address. This involves checking caches (browser, operating system) and contacting DNS servers (recursive resolver, root servers, TLD servers, and authoritative servers) to find the correct IP.

---

### Step 2: **Establishing a Connection (TCP/IP)**
Once the IP address is found, your browser establishes a connection to Google’s server using the TCP/IP protocol. This includes a "three-way handshake" to ensure a reliable connection before data is exchanged.

---

### Step 3: **Firewall Check**
The request passes through firewalls on both ends (your device and Google’s servers) to filter out malicious traffic and ensure security.

---

### Step 4: **Securing the Connection with HTTPS**
Because the URL starts with `https://`, an SSL/TLS handshake occurs. The server sends its certificate, which is verified by your browser, and a secure, encrypted connection is established.

---

### Step 5: **Load Balancing**
Google uses load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers. This ensures optimal performance and prevents overloading any single server.

---

### Step 6: **Web Server Handling**
The request is routed to a web server, such as Nginx or Apache, which serves static content (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript files) to your browser.

---

### Step 7: **Application Server Processing**
For dynamic content, the web server forwards the request to an application server. This server processes backend logic to generate the necessary data for the response.

---

### Step 8: **Database Interaction**
If the response requires data (e.g., search results), the application server queries a database. The database retrieves the information and sends it back to the application server.

---

### Step 9: **Rendering the Web Page**
The application server combines the data and sends an HTML page to your browser. Your browser parses the HTML, loads resources (CSS, JavaScript, images), and renders the page for you to interact with.

---

### Conclusion
From DNS resolution to rendering the webpage, the process is a collaboration between multiple technologies. Understanding these steps highlights the complexity of delivering a single webpage.
